Heart failure is an increasingly common and potentially fatal condition that occurs when a person's heart is unable to pump or fill with enough blood to support the body. In this study, I examined a data set of 300 heart failure patients and their associated lifestyle and biological data. The purpose of this study is to 1: determine the biomarkers with the strongest predictive power and 2: create a robust predictive model to determine patient survivability. First, I performed an exploratory data analysis of the patient data. Using these insights, I trained several classifiers to determine survivability. Through this process, I find ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and age are the 3 most effective predictors of a heart failure patient's survival.
